    <!-- "div" like is a container or box
    "div" is a container element that is used to group together HTML elements and apply CSS styles to them.
    "div" elements are commonly used to create sections of a web page, such as headers, footers, sidebars, and content areas.
    Some important points about the "div" element are:
    1. The "div" element is a block-level element, which means it takes up the full width of its parent container by default.
    2. The "div" element can be styled using CSS properties such as background-color, height, width, margin, padding, border, and more.
    3. The "div" element can be nested inside other HTML elements, such as body, section, article, and more.
    4. The "div" element can be used to create layouts and structure web pages -->
