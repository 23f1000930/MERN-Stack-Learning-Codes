// JavaScript can dynamically manipulate both HTML and CSS, allowing it to change webpage content, 
// structure, and styling in real time. It also has access to user interactions, such as mouse 
// movements, clicks, and keyboard inputs, enabling the creation of interactive and responsive 
// web experiences.

// Why use JavaScript?
//1. Easy To Use: JavaScript is easy to use because its syntax is simple and beginner-friendly,
// making it quick to learn and apply on web pages.

//2. Lightweight: It is lightweight, meaning it runs directly in the web browser without needing 
// extra software or compilation, so it works fast and efficiently.

//3. Security: It is also secure, as it does not have direct access to the system’s memory or files, which helps protect the user’s computer from harmful operations.
